                 In the <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/sdlc_iterative_model.htm">Iterative model</a>, iterative process starts with a simple implementation of a small set of the software
                 requirements and iteratively enhances the evolving versions until the complete system is implemented and
                ready to be deployed.

                An iterative life cycle model does not attempt to start with a full specification of requirements. Instead, development begins by specifying and implementing just part of the software,
                which is then reviewed in order to identify further requirements. This process is then repeated, producing a new version of the software at the end of each iteration of the model." <br>
        
                "The advantage of this model is that there is a working model of the system at a very early stage of
                development which makes it easier to find functional or design flaws. Finding issues at an early stage
                of development enables to take corrective measures in a limited budget.

                The disadvantage with this SDLC model is that it is applicable only to large and bulky software development 
                projects. This is because it is hard to break a small software system into further small serviceable
                increments/modules."
