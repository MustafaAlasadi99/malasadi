                "The <a href="  https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/sdlc_waterfall_model.htm">waterfall model</a> was first Process Model to be introduced. It is also referred to as a 
                linear-sequential life cycle model. It is very simple to understand and use. In a waterfall model, each phase must be completed before the next phase can begin and there is no
                overlapping in the phases. Waterfall model is the earliest SDLC approach that was used for software development .

                The waterfall Model illustrates the software development process in a linear sequential flow; 
                hence it is also referred to as a linear-sequential life cycle model. This means that any phase in the development
                process begins only if the previous phase is complete. In waterfall model phases do not overlap."
                <br>
                "The advantage of waterfall development is that it allows for departmentalization and control. A schedule can be set with deadlines for each stage of development and a product can 
                proceed through the development process model phases one by one." <br>

                "The disadvantage of waterfall development is that it does not allow for much reflection or revision. Once an application is in the testing stage, it is very difficult to go back and change
                something that was not well-documented or thought upon in the concept stage.

                Development moves from concept, through design, implementation, testing, installation, troubleshooting, and 
                ends up at operation and maintenance. Each phase of development proceeds in strict order."
