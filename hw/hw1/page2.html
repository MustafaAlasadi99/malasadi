                        "The <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/sdlc_spiral_model.htm">spiral model</a> combines the idea of iterative development with the systematic, controlled aspects of the 
                        waterfall model.
                        Spiral model is a combination of iterative development process model and sequential linear development model i.e. waterfall model with very high emphasis on risk analysis.
                        It allows for incremental releases of the product, or incremental refinement through each iteration around the spiral." <br/>
                        "The advantage of spiral lifecycle model is that it allows for elements of the product to be added in when they become available or known. This assures that there is no 
                        conflict with previous requirements and design.
                        This method is consistent with approaches that have multiple software builds and releases and allows for making an orderly transition to a maintenance activity. Another
                        positive aspect is that the spiral model forces early user involvement in the system development effort.

                        On the other side, it takes very strict management to complete such products and there is a risk of running the spiral in indefinite loop. So the discipline of change
                        and the extent of taking change requests is very important to develop and deploy the product successfully."
